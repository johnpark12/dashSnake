MULTIPLAYER SNAKE:
Designed to be played with 3 or more players.
Whole map will be visible.
Map contains obstacles that snakes can maneuver around.
Player controls a snake. Standard arrow key controls PLUS pressing the spacebar causes the snake to speed up temporarily (with a cooldown).
Can direct the snake to either:
 eat food which will cause the snake to grow
 slam into other snakes which will cause both snakes to lose length equivalent to that of the shorter snake (ie. the shorter snake dies, the longer snake is made shorter).

ARCHITECTURE:
Simple architecture of registering only the key presses on the server side and sending out board state to everyone. Doing so will make lag appear as a delayed response of the piece that they're controlling.
Game modelling logic will be handled on the server side.
Decoupled the game logic from the DOM rendering. In a more complicated game, it would also make sense to further break down game logic. Decoupling also allows us to move rendering to browser and logic to server.

DEVELOPMENT:
Build a single player version:
 Map generation
 Snake generation
 Frame generation
 Seperating the logic and rendering into server and client respectively.
 Registering player keypresses on the server side.
